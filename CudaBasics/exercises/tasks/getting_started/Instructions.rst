1. Log in to JURON

#. The exercises should already be in your account. If not, copy them.

#. Load the needed module by sourcing ``setup.sh`` (``source setup.sh``)

#. Run ``make`` to build the programs.

#. Run all benchmarks by executing ``./bench_all.sh``. Each benchmark will run with its own batch job and create a plot that compares performance for different setups. You can ignore the warning and error messages. In the end, four result plots should appear on your screen. If not, talk to one of the tutors.
