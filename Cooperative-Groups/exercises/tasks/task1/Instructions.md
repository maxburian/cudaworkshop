# Cooperative Groups: Task 1

In this task we transform a legacy kernel written with the classical CUDA threading model into a kernel using Cooperative Groups (CG). In this example, the maximum value of an array is searched.

The program does run in its initial version and does produce correct output.

Work on the TODOs to implement the changes.

Compile with `make` and submit the executable to the batch system with `make run`.
