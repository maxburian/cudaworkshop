Matrix Multiplication using multiple GPUs in the same host
----------------------------------------------------------

In this task, use multiple GPUs to speed up the matrix multiplication task. 
Strip the matrix A into two equal halves A0 and A1. 
GPU 0 calculates : A0 * B = C0
GPU 1 calculates : A1 * B = C1
Use the dgemm_multigpu.cu file for this task and compare the time for execution with the simple matrix multiplication (dgemm_gpu_simple).
Use cudaSetDevice(...) in appropriate places to target a particular device on which your cuda calls need to issued.
