GPUDirect Example
-----------------
This purpose of this task is to create a CUDA program that uses two GPUs for computation from the same host thread. Furthermore, the task aims at illustrating the performance of using GPUdirect in copying data from one GPU to another, as compared to using a host buffer to transfer data between GPUs. The file gpudirect example.cu contains two kernels (kernel gpu0,kernel gpu1) that is to be executed on device 0 and 1 respectively. kernel gpu0 works on g0 (which is stored in its device memory) and kernel gpu1 works on g1. The output of kernel gpu0 (modified g0) is the input for kernel gpu1 (g0 copied to g1). Implement this scenerio in run copy without gpudirect() without using peer to peer transfer and run copy with gpudirect() with peer to peer transfer.
